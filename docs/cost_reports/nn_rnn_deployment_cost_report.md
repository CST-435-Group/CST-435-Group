--- ASSUMPTIONS ---
• [List all assumptions made, e.g., "Assumed 99% uptime"]
• [e.g., "Used on-demand pricing; reserved instances would reduce cost by ~40%"]
• [e.g., "Assumed average inference time of 50ms based on local testing"]
• [e.g., "Data transfer costs assume 10 KB per request"]

--- OPTIMIZATION RECOMMENDATIONS ---
• [e.g., "Consider spot instances for training to reduce costs by 70%"]
• [e.g., "Implement model quantization to reduce inference cost"]
• [e.g., "Use caching for repeated requests"]

--- COST COMPARISON ---
[Compare with alternative approaches if applicable]
Alternative Model: [e.g., Transformer model]
Cost Difference: [e.g., "+150% more expensive"]
Performance Difference: [e.g., "+10% accuracy"]
Cost-Efficiency Trade-off: [Analysis]
