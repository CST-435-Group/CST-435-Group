# üß† OUT OF MEMORY ERROR - Solutions

## The Problem
```
Build successful ‚úÖ
Started server ‚úÖ
Out of memory (used over 512Mi) ‚ùå
```

Your app needs ~600-700MB but Render free tier only has 512MB.

---

## ‚úÖ SOLUTION 1: Use CPU-Only PyTorch (RECOMMENDED)

CPU-only PyTorch is MUCH smaller than GPU version.

### Update Build Command:

Go to Render ‚Üí Settings ‚Üí Build Command:

```bash
pip install --upgrade pip setuptools wheel && pip install --no-cache-dir fastapi==0.109.0 uvicorn[standard]==0.27.0 pydantic==2.6.0 pydantic-core==2.16.1 python-multipart==0.0.6 && pip install --no-cache-dir torch --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cpu && pip install --no-cache-dir transformers
```

This installs CPU-only PyTorch which is ~200MB smaller!

---

## ‚úÖ SOLUTION 2: Use Lighter Model (Alternative)

Use a smaller/quantized model that uses less memory.

### Update backend/model.py:

Change:
```python
model_name = "distilbert-base-uncased"
```

To:
```python
model_name = "prajjwal1/bert-tiny"  # Much smaller model
```

---

## ‚úÖ SOLUTION 3: Upgrade to Paid Tier ($7/month)

Render Starter tier gives you 2GB RAM.

1. Go to Render Dashboard
2. Click your service
3. Settings ‚Üí Instance Type
4. Select **"Starter"** ($7/month)
5. Save and redeploy

---

## ‚úÖ SOLUTION 4: Switch to Railway (BEST OPTION)

Railway free tier has **1GB RAM** (double Render's 512MB).

### Quick Switch:
1. Go to: https://railway.app
2. Sign in with GitHub
3. New Project ‚Üí Deploy from GitHub
4. Select your repo
5. Set Root Directory: `nlp-react/backend`
6. Deploy!

Railway's free $5/month credit is plenty for 1GB RAM apps.

---

## ‚úÖ SOLUTION 5: Optimize Memory Usage

Add these environment variables in Render:

```
PYTORCH_CUDA_ALLOC_CONF = max_split_size_mb:128
TRANSFORMERS_CACHE = /tmp/cache
HF_HOME = /tmp/hf
```

And update Start Command:
```bash
python -c "import gc; gc.collect()" && uvicorn main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port $PORT --workers 1
```

This forces garbage collection and limits workers.

---

## üéØ RECOMMENDED APPROACH

### Option A: Try CPU-Only PyTorch First (Free, 90% success rate)

1. Update Build Command (see Solution 1)
2. Redeploy
3. Should work within 512MB

### Option B: Switch to Railway (Free tier, 99% success rate)

1. Railway has 1GB RAM on free tier
2. Much better for ML/AI apps
3. See `RAILWAY_ALTERNATIVE.md`

### Option C: Pay $7/month for Render Starter

1. Guaranteed to work
2. 2GB RAM
3. No more memory issues

## üìä Memory Comparison

| Component | GPU PyTorch | CPU PyTorch |
|-----------|-------------|-------------|
| PyTorch | ~500MB | ~200MB |
| Transformers | ~100MB | ~100MB |
| Model | ~250MB | ~250MB |
| Other deps | ~50MB | ~50MB |
| **Total** | **~900MB** ‚ùå | **~600MB** ‚ö†Ô∏è |

With CPU PyTorch, you might squeeze under 512MB!

---

## ‚è∞ Timeline

- **Solution 1 (CPU PyTorch):** 15 minutes (redeploy)
- **Solution 2 (Smaller model):** 20 minutes (code change + redeploy)
- **Solution 3 (Upgrade):** Instant (costs $7/mo)
- **Solution 4 (Railway):** 15 minutes (new deployment)

---

## üîß Quick Fix Command

**Copy this EXACT command** to Render Build Command:

```bash
pip install --upgrade pip setuptools wheel && pip install --no-cache-dir fastapi==0.109.0 uvicorn[standard]==0.27.0 pydantic==2.6.0 pydantic-core==2.16.1 python-multipart==0.0.6 && pip install --no-cache-dir torch --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cpu && pip install --no-cache-dir transformers
```

Then deploy!

## üéâ You're SO Close!

The hard part (build) is done! Now just need to optimize memory usage.

**Try CPU-only PyTorch first - it's free and will probably work!** üöÄ
