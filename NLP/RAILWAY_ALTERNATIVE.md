# 🚂 Alternative: Deploy to Railway Instead

## Why Railway?

Render is giving you persistent issues with pydantic/Rust compilation.
**Railway often "just works"** with Python projects.

---

## ⚡ Deploy to Railway (10 minutes)

### Step 1: Sign Up (1 minute)
1. Go to: https://railway.app
2. Click **"Start a New Project"** or **"Login"**
3. Choose **"Login with GitHub"**
4. Authorize Railway

**Note:** Railway requires a credit card but gives you **$5/month free credit** (enough for this project)

---

### Step 2: Create New Project (2 minutes)

1. Click **"New Project"**
2. Select **"Deploy from GitHub repo"**
3. If prompted, click **"Configure GitHub App"**
4. Select **"All repositories"** or just your repo
5. Click **"Install"**
6. Select your `nlp-react` or `CST-435-Group` repository

---

### Step 3: Configure Settings (2 minutes)

Railway might auto-detect everything, but verify:

1. Click **"Settings"** (⚙️ icon)
2. Scroll to **"Service"** section
3. Check/Set these:

```
Root Directory: nlp-react/backend
Start Command: uvicorn main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port $PORT
```

Railway auto-detects `requirements.txt` and installs packages automatically!

---

### Step 4: Add Environment Variable (Optional)

If you want to be extra safe:

1. Click **"Variables"** tab
2. Add:
```
PYTHON_VERSION = 3.11
```

---

### Step 5: Deploy! (5-10 minutes)

1. Railway automatically starts deploying
2. Watch the logs in the dashboard
3. First deploy takes 5-10 minutes
4. You'll see:
   ```
   Installing dependencies...
   Downloading model...
   Starting server...
   ✅ Deployment successful!
   ```

---

### Step 6: Get Your URL

1. Go to **"Settings"** tab
2. Scroll to **"Networking"** section
3. Click **"Generate Domain"**
4. You'll get a URL like: `https://your-app.up.railway.app`

**Copy this URL!** You'll need it for your frontend.

---

### Step 7: Test Your Backend

Visit:
```
https://your-railway-url.up.railway.app/health
```

Should return:
```json
{
  "status": "healthy",
  "model_loaded": true
}
```

## ✅ Advantages of Railway

- ✓ **Better Python support** - Fewer dependency issues
- ✓ **Faster deployments** - Usually 5-10 min vs Render's 10-15 min
- ✓ **Faster wake-up** - 10-20 seconds vs Render's 30-60 seconds
- ✓ **Auto-detects everything** - Less configuration needed
- ✓ **Better build caching** - Subsequent deploys in 2-3 min

## ⚠️ Disadvantages

- Requires credit card (not charged unless you exceed $5/month)
- Slightly more expensive if you go over free tier

---

## 💰 Free Tier Details

**Railway Free Tier:**
- $5 credit per month
- ≈ 500 execution hours
- Enough for 24/7 operation of small apps
- No charge if you stay under $5

**For this project:**
- Backend uses ~$3-4/month if running 24/7
- **You'll stay within free tier** ✓

---

## 🔄 If You Switch from Render to Railway

### What to Update:

1. **Delete Render service** (optional, to avoid confusion)
2. **Copy new Railway URL**
3. **Update frontend environment variable:**
   - Vercel → Settings → Environment Variables
   - Change `VITE_API_URL` to your new Railway URL
   - Redeploy frontend

## 🎯 Railway Configuration Summary

| Setting | Value |
|---------|-------|
| **Platform** | Railway.app |
| **Root Directory** | `nlp-react/backend` |
| **Start Command** | `uvicorn main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port $PORT` |
| **Build Command** | (Auto-detected from requirements.txt) |
| **Python Version** | 3.11 (recommended) |

---

## 🐛 Troubleshooting Railway

### If deploy fails:

**Check build logs** for errors:
- Click on deployment
- View logs
- Look for specific error messages

**Common fixes:**
1. Verify Root Directory is `nlp-react/backend`
2. Check that requirements.txt is in the correct location
3. Add `PYTHON_VERSION=3.11` environment variable

## 📊 Comparison: Render vs Railway

| Feature | Render | Railway |
|---------|--------|---------|
| **Setup** | Easier (no card) | Medium (needs card) |
| **Python Support** | Sometimes issues | Excellent |
| **Build Time** | 10-15 min | 5-10 min |
| **Wake Time** | 30-60 sec | 10-20 sec |
| **Reliability** | Good | Excellent |
| **Free Tier** | 750 hrs | $5 credit |

## 💡 Recommendation

**If you have a credit card available:**
→ Use **Railway** (better Python support, fewer headaches)

**If you don't have a credit card:**
→ Try the **FASTEST_FIX.md** solution for Render (bypass requirements.txt)

**If nothing works:**
→ Ask instructor about alternative platforms or local hosting options
