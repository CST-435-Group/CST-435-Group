# Alternative Datasets if Safebooru URLs don't work:

## Option 1: Use CIFAR-10 (Animal categories)
- Easy to download
- Already in grayscale-convertible format
- 5 animal classes: airplane, automobile, bird, cat, deer, dog, etc.

## Option 2: Download images manually from Danbooru/Safebooru
- Use the Danbooru API directly
- More reliable image downloads

## Option 3: Generate synthetic training data
- For demonstration purposes
- Create simple patterns for each category

## Quick Fix: Run the diagnostic first

```bash
python check_dataset.py
```

This will show you what columns are available in the dataset.

## If URLs are broken, use this fallback:

The Safebooru Kaggle dataset appears to contain only metadata. The actual images need to be downloaded from Safebooru.org, but many URLs may be expired or broken.

### Recommended Solution:

1. **Use a working image dataset** like:
   - Anime Face Dataset (has actual images)
   - Pokemon Images Dataset  
   - CIFAR-10 (convert to grayscale)

2. **Or download Safebooru images differently**:
   - Use the Safebooru API directly
   - Use `gallery-dl` tool to batch download

Would you like me to create a version using:
- A) CIFAR-10 (quick, reliable, works immediately)
- B) A Pokemon/Anime dataset with actual images
- C) Continue trying to fix Safebooru URLs

Let me know and I'll adjust the training script!
